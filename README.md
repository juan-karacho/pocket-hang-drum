# pocket-hang-drum

This is a digital remake of the hang drum.

Did you ever feel that the original Hang Drum is a really cool instrument but ways too expensive? Not digital enough? Not hackable? And way too big and heavy? Then this digital pocket version of the Hang Drum is for you.

# components

* Wooden Box
* Teensy 3.2 (should work with other Teensy Versions as well)
* Audio Shield for Teensy 3.2
* Arduino Thumb Joystick
* Adafruit MPR121 capacitive touch sensor
* I used stripboard, headerpins / female header pins and wires to connect it all together
* Conductive foil tape. I use copper tape.

# Building instructions

* Drill 12 holes in the top of the box for 12 

# If I built a second version then I would...

* either ommit the joystick or use a better joystick. The one I used is too noisy so I could not use it for pitch bend. Thats why I came up with the transpose and release functionality for the joystick, it should have other functionalities.
* add a voltage regulator, external power connector (probably compatible to guitar pedals) and 9V battery pack
* add more encoders on the side of the instrument to add more soundshaping capabilities: Wave form selector, ADSR, scale selector, ...
